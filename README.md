# OpenVRT Android

OpenVRT is an open-source protocol for [Variable Rate Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Rate_Technology).

It consists of an embedded system like [Arduino](https://github.com/luizguilhermefr/OpenVRT-Firmware), controlled by a master like this App, controlling the input flow rate on the machine.

The App must be fed with a GeoJSON *prescription map*, that will have the application grid for the tillage.
